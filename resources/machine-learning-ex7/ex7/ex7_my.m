%% ============= Part 4: K-Means Clustering on Pixels ===============
%  In this exercise, you will use K-Means to compress an image. To do this,
%  you will first run K-Means on the colors of the pixels in the image and
%  then you will map each pixel onto its closest centroid.
%  
%  You should now complete the code in kMeansInitCentroids.m
%

fprintf('\nRunning K-Means clustering on pixels from an image.\n\n');

%  Load an image of a bird
A = double(imread('Cristiano.jpg'));

% If imread does not work for you, you can try instead
%   load ('bird_small.mat');

A = A / 255; % Divide by 255 so that all values are in the range 0 - 1

% Size of the image
img_size = size(A);

% Reshape the image into an Nx3 matrix where N = number of pixels.
% Each row will contain the Red, Green and Blue pixel values
% This gives us our dataset matrix X that we will use K-Means on.
% 128 * 128 * 3 = 16384 * 3
X = reshape(A, img_size(1) * img_size(2), 3);

% Run your K-Means algorithm on this data
% You should try different values of K and max_iters here
K = 24; 
max_iters = 10;

% When using K-Means, it is important the initialize the centroids
% randomly. 
% You should complete the code in kMeansInitCentroids.m before proceeding
initial_centroids = kMeansInitCentroids(X, K);

% Run K-Means
% 不展示图片，因为无法展示
[centroids, idx] = runkMeans(X, initial_centroids, max_iters);

% 选作内容，对自己的图片使用k-means算法进行图片压缩

%% ================= Part 5: Image Compression ======================
%  In this part of the exercise, you will use the clusters of K-Means to
%  compress an image. To do this, we first find the closest clusters for
%  each example. After that, we 

fprintf('\nApplying K-Means to compress an image.\n\n');

% Find closest cluster members
idx = findClosestCentroids(X, centroids);

% Essentially, now we have represented the image X as in terms of the
% indices in idx. 

% We can now recover the image from the indices (idx) by mapping each pixel
% (specified by its index in idx) to the centroid value
X_recovered = centroids(idx,:);

% Reshape the recovered image into proper dimensions
X_recovered = reshape(X_recovered, img_size(1), img_size(2), 3);

% Display the original image 
subplot(1, 2, 1);
imagesc(A); 
title('Original');

% Display compressed image side by side
subplot(1, 2, 2);
imagesc(X_recovered)
title(sprintf('Compressed, with %d colors.', K));
