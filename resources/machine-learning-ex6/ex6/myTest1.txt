 We are pleased to announce that the highly anticipated NVIDIA Isaac Software Development Kit and Isaac Emulator are now available for robot developers.

 The Isaac Software Development Kit is a developer toolkit for accelerating the development and deployment of AI robots based on the NVIDIA platform.
• Isaac Robot Engine – This framework makes it easy to build modular applications
• Isaac Gems - This modular algorithm enables sensing, mapping, navigation and startup
• Isaac Reference Platform - NVIDIA Carter (internal automatic distribution/logistics robot based on NVIDIA Jetson AGX XavierTM) and Kaya (based on Jetson NanoTM)
 The Isaac Simulator is a virtual robotic lab and high-fidelity 3D world simulator for accelerating the research, design and development of robots. This version includes
• Test three environments for the Carter robotic navigation stack
• Domain randomization of control parameters in a scenario
• Load the robot model into Isaac Sim's robot builder
 Please share your feedback and suggestions on our Developer Forum to help us promote and improve the Isaac SDK.
